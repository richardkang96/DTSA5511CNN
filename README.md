# DTSA 5511 - CNN
This repo includes the Jupyter Notebook for my CNN project for my Introduction to Deep Learning course, part of University of Colorado Boulder's Master of Science in Data Science program. The goal of the project was to participate in a Kaggle participation and build a model that would accurately classify someone with cancer based on pathology images.
